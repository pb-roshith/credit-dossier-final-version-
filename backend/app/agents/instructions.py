ANTI_HALLUCINATION_FOOTER = """

CRITICAL ANTI-HALLUCINATION RULES (MANDATORY):
1. ONLY use information retrieved from the document library via your search tool.
2. If the library search returns no relevant documents for a data point, explicitly state "[Data not available in provided documents]".
3. NEVER fabricate or invent numbers, dates, percentages, financial figures, credit ratings, or growth rates.
4. When citing data from a document, you MUST include an inline citation like [1], [2], etc.
5. At the very bottom of your response, you MUST include a "## References" section listing each citation. 
6. In the References section, you MUST wrap the exact document name in double square brackets like this: [[Document Name.pdf]]. Include the page number or section if available. Example: "[1] [[Halfords Annual Report.pdf]], page 12"
7. If insufficient data is available to write a complete sub-section, produce what you can from available documents and clearly mark gaps with "[Insufficient data]".
8. Do NOT extrapolate trends beyond what the documents explicitly state.
9. Distinguish clearly between facts from documents and your analytical commentary.
10. Do NOT include a main title/heading for the section — the system adds that automatically. You may use subheadings.
11. Use markdown formatting for structure (bullets, tables, bold, etc.).
12. NEVER output any preamble, introductory text, or summary of your search actions (e.g. do NOT output "Searching for...", "Here is the section...", etc). Output ONLY the final markdown content for the section.
13. If an ORCHESTRATION STRATEGY is provided, use its recommended search queries and priority data points to focus your library search. Prioritize the documents and data points indicated.
14. If the orchestration strategy identifies GAPS (missing data), proactively mark those areas with "[Data not available]" rather than inventing content.

OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY & ASSET UTILIZATION RATIOS

| Metric                 | FY23 | FY24 | FY25 | FY26 |
|------------------------|------|------|------|------|
| Fixed Asset Turnover    |      |      |      |      |
| Capex/Sales             |      |      |      |      |

SOLVENCY AND LEVERAGE RATIOS

| Metric                          | FY23 | FY24 | FY25 | FY26 |
|----------------------------------|------|------|------|------|
| Total Debt/EBITDA                |      |      |      |      |
| Interest Coverage Ratio (A/B)     |      |      |      |      |
|   A: EBITDA                       |      |      |      |      |
|   B: Interest Expense             |      |      |      |      |

PROFITABILITY RATIOS

| Metric              | FY23 | FY24 | FY25 | FY26 |
|----------------------|------|------|------|------|
| Gross Margin          |      |      |      |      |

| Return on Assets      |      |      |      |      |
| Return on Equity      |      |      |      |      |

INTERPRETATION RATIONALE (apply strictly; do not invent new thresholds):

Fixed Asset Turnover:
- A declining ratio suggests excess/idle capacity or over-investment in
  inefficient equipment.

Capex/Sales:
- A continuously declining ratio may indicate underinvestment in maintenance,
  risking future operational breakdown.

Total Debt/EBITDA:
- Should be < 3.0x. Higher leverage negatively impacts the firm, especially
  during a cyclical downturn.

Interest Coverage Ratio:
- 3.0x–4.0x is preferred. A lower ratio risks default if interest rates rise
  or revenues dip.

Gross Margin:
- Lower gross margin reflects weak pricing power.

EBITDA Margin:
- Reflects the cash-flow-generating ability of the business. Declining trend
  signals weakening core profitability.

Net Profit Margin:
- Higher margins act as a buffer, allowing the company to absorb unexpected
  cost increases or revenue declines without becoming unprofitable/defaulting.

Return on Assets (ROA):
- Low ROA suggests inefficient use of assets to generate profits and signals
  higher credit risk — may result in loan denial or stricter lending terms
  (higher interest rate, more collateral).

Return on Equity (ROE):
- Low ROE indicates poor use of shareholder funds and underlying
  profitability issues.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:

1. Reproduce the data tables exactly as given under their three categories:
   Operational Efficiency & Asset Utilization, Solvency & Leverage, Profitability.

2. For each ratio, provide a 2–3 line trend commentary across FY23–FY26
   (improving/deteriorating/stable), citing actual figures, and explicitly apply
   the corresponding rationale/threshold stated above. Where a numeric threshold
   exists (Total Debt/EBITDA, Interest Coverage), explicitly flag whether the
   latest year falls within or outside the acceptable range.

3. Group commentary under three sub-headers matching the categories above.

4. Conclude with a "Ratio Analysis Risk Assessment" summary paragraph
   (120–180 words) that:
   - States overall direction across efficiency, leverage, and profitability
   - Explicitly flags Total Debt/EBITDA and Interest Coverage against their
     thresholds for the latest year
   - Highlights any red flags (declining Fixed Asset Turnover, declining
     Capex/Sales, Debt/EBITDA > 3x, Interest Coverage < 3x, declining margins,
     low/declining ROA or ROE)
   - Avoids speculation beyond what the data supports

5. If any input field is "NA" or missing, explicitly state "Data not available"
   for that metric rather than estimating or fabricating a number.

6. Output format:
   a) Data Tables (as provided/completed, grouped by category)
   b) Category-wise Trend Commentary (bulleted, one bullet per metric,
      grouped under its category sub-header)
   c) Ratio Analysis Risk Assessment (narrative paragraph)

TONE: Formal, objective, third-person, consistent with institutional credit
rating report language. Do not use hedging phrases like "might" or "could
possibly" — state findings based strictly on the data and defined thresholds/
rationale.

STRUCTURE:
1. Data Tables grouped by category
   - Operational Efficiency & Asset Utilization (Fixed Asset Turnover, Capex/Sales)
